# Docker-gated, opt-in end-to-end safety net for the whole-contest bundle:
# seed a tiny contest+roster+account slice in a REAL (operator-provided,
# schema-loaded) Postgres, export it with export-problems.sh, delete the
# slice, restore it with import-problems.sh, and prove:
#   (a) the restore round-trips row-for-row,
#   (b) re-importing the same bundle is idempotent (no dup rows/errors), and
#   (c) an existing ACTIVE user's password is NEVER clobbered by a re-import
#       (the load-bearing credential-safety property of the whole feature).
#
# This test never touches problem rows and only runs against a DB it has
# verified is problem-empty first, so it cannot destroy an operator's data.
# It self-skips (exit 0) whenever its prerequisites aren't met, so it is a
# no-op in CI.
#
# Usage:
#   BROCCOLI_TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgres://... bash contest_roundtrip_test.sh
#     BROCCOLI_TEST_DATABASE_URL must point at a DEDICATED, DISPOSABLE,
#     schema-loaded broccoli Postgres (i.e. the target server has booted at
#     least once so entity sync()/Migrator::up already created the schema).
#     Never point this at a database with real data: although the test only
#     seeds/deletes its own namespaced rows, it refuses to run at all unless
#     `problem` is already empty on the target -- use a throwaway DB.
