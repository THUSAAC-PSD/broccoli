# REGRESSION (worker-role release blocker): the worker image bakes isolate plus

# bind-mount of that path makes Docker auto-create an empty DIRECTORY at the
# missing source and mount it over the image's config file, so the container
# dies at start with "mount ... not a directory" and the worker never joins.
# The mount is also redundant (image is self-contained). Assert it is gone.
