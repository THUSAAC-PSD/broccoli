# REGRESSION (server-role release blocker, silent): the runtime stage runs as the
# distroless nonroot uid 65532, whose HOME (/home/nonroot) is NOT writable by that
# user in the base image. wasmtime (via extism) derives its plugin compilation
# cache from $HOME and fails plugin init() with "failed to create cache directory"
# when it cannot mkdir under $HOME. Every evaluator/checker/hook plugin then fails
# to register: the server boots "healthy" but the evaluator registry is empty, so
# no problem can be created ("problem_type must be one of:" empty) and nothing
# judges. The image must bake a writable, uid-owned HOME and point the process at
# it. Assert all three legs of that fix so a base bump or refactor can't silently
# reintroduce the empty-registry failure.

# 1. The shell-bearing builder stage creates the home dir (distroless can't mkdir).

#    `ENV CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=${CARGO_BUILD_JOBS}`; an UNSET build-arg expands to an
#    empty string, and cargo rejects "" hard ("could not parse ``"). build-bundle.sh
#    (the shipped air-gap staging entrypoint) passes NO --build-arg, so an empty
#    default is a release blocker — the bundle's server image cannot build. Assert
#    the ARG defaults to a value cargo accepts (`default` or a number).
