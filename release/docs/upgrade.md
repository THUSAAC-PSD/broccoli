# Upgrade Guide

Use pinned image tags. Do not use `latest` for contest deployments.

## Standard Upgrade

Infra images are upgraded only during a maintenance window. For normal platform
releases, upgrade application roles first:

1. Upgrade each worker node by editing `BROCCOLI_WORKER_IMAGE` in that node's
   `.env.worker`, then:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.worker -f docker-compose.worker.yaml up -d --no-deps worker
docker compose --env-file .env.worker -f docker-compose.worker.yaml ps worker
```

2. Upgrade server nodes one at a time by editing `BROCCOLI_SERVER_IMAGE`, then:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.server -f docker-compose.server.yaml up -d --no-deps server
docker compose --env-file .env.server -f docker-compose.server.yaml ps server
set -a; . ./.env.server; set +a
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:${BROCCOLI_HTTP_BIND##*:}/healthz
```

3. If a gateway is present, keep it running while server nodes roll. Restart it
   only after all upstream server health checks pass.

The workers-first order preserves the rolling-upgrade path while per-replica
operation-result queues are introduced. The legacy `operation_results` queue is
kept for one release for compatibility and is scheduled for removal in the next
release.

## Rolling-Upgrade Rehearsal

Rehearse the upgrade on the same role topology as production: infra node, server
node or nodes, and one worker per judge host.

```bash
export OLD_VERSION=v0.2.0
export NEW_VERSION=v0.3.0-rc.1
```

Install the old version first, then update worker nodes:

```bash
sed -i.bak \
  "s#^BROCCOLI_WORKER_IMAGE=.*#BROCCOLI_WORKER_IMAGE=ghcr.io/thusaac-psd/broccoli/broccoli-worker:${NEW_VERSION}-icpc#" \
  .env.worker
docker compose --env-file .env.worker -f docker-compose.worker.yaml up -d --no-deps worker
docker compose --env-file .env.worker -f docker-compose.worker.yaml ps worker
```

Run correctness through a server or gateway URL. Then update server nodes one at
a time:

```bash
sed -i.bak \
  "s#^BROCCOLI_SERVER_IMAGE=.*#BROCCOLI_SERVER_IMAGE=ghcr.io/thusaac-psd/broccoli/broccoli-server:${NEW_VERSION}#" \
  .env.server
docker compose --env-file .env.server -f docker-compose.server.yaml up -d --no-deps server
set -a; . ./.env.server; set +a
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:${BROCCOLI_HTTP_BIND##*:}/healthz
```

During the window, submissions should complete successfully and server logs
should not show legacy `operation_results` warnings for new work.

## Rollback

1. Restore the previous image tag in the affected node's `.env.<role>`.
2. Run
   `docker compose --env-file .env.<role> -f docker-compose.<role>.yaml up -d`.
3. Confirm the role health check.
4. Check logs for failed submissions or operation-result queue warnings.

Roll back server nodes one at a time when a gateway is present. Roll back
workers before servers when both roles were upgraded.

## Worker Image Variants

Use the `-icpc` worker for normal contests. Use `-base` only when deriving a
custom image with your own toolchains. Use `-full` for open-format contests that
need Node.js, Rust, Go, Pascal, or Kotlin.
