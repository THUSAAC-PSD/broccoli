# Operator Runbook

Run commands on the machine that owns the role.

The role compose files use per-role env files. If bypassing `install.sh`, copy
or create the matching `.env.<role>` first and always pass
`--env-file .env.<role>` to Docker Compose.

## Status

Infra node:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.infra -f docker-compose.infra.yaml ps
docker compose --env-file .env.infra -f docker-compose.infra.yaml logs --tail=200 db redis seaweedfs seaweedfs-init
```

Server node:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.server -f docker-compose.server.yaml ps
set -a; . ./.env.server; set +a
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:${BROCCOLI_HTTP_BIND##*:}/healthz
docker compose --env-file .env.server -f docker-compose.server.yaml logs --tail=200 server
```

Worker node:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.worker -f docker-compose.worker.yaml ps
docker compose --env-file .env.worker -f docker-compose.worker.yaml logs --tail=200 worker
```

Gateway node:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.gateway -f docker-compose.gateway.yaml ps
set -a; . ./.env.gateway; set +a
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:${BROCCOLI_GATEWAY_HTTP_BIND##*:}/healthz
docker compose --env-file .env.gateway -f docker-compose.gateway.yaml logs --tail=200 gateway
```

## Restart

Restart one role at a time:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.worker -f docker-compose.worker.yaml restart worker
docker compose --env-file .env.server -f docker-compose.server.yaml restart server
docker compose --env-file .env.gateway -f docker-compose.gateway.yaml restart gateway
```

For server redundancy, restart one server machine at a time and confirm the
gateway stays healthy before moving to the next server. Avoid restarting infra
during a contest window.

## Plugin Reload

The server image contains the default plugins and also mounts `./plugins`. After
replacing plugin files on a server node, restart that server or use the admin UI
plugin reload action:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.server -f docker-compose.server.yaml restart server
```

Repeat per server node.

## Password Reset

Use the admin UI when another admin account is available. If all admin accounts
are locked out, edit the server node `.env.server` and restart the server:

```bash
BROCCOLI_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
BROCCOLI_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD=replace-this-password
docker compose --env-file .env.server -f docker-compose.server.yaml up -d --no-deps server
```

Remove or rotate the bootstrap password after login.

## Logs

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.server -f docker-compose.server.yaml logs -f server
docker compose --env-file .env.worker -f docker-compose.worker.yaml logs -f worker
docker compose --env-file .env.infra -f docker-compose.infra.yaml logs -f db redis seaweedfs
```

For worker sandbox failures, first confirm the worker service is privileged and
that the worker host uses cgroup v2.

## Storage Checks

The recommended (and default) backend is `object_storage`. The `database`
backend exists for tiny demos with no S3 available, but cannot survive even a
50-submission burst because every blob fetch holds a Postgres connection for the
entire stream.

If `BROCCOLI__STORAGE__BACKEND=object_storage`, SeaweedFS runs on the infra
node. Confirm the bucket exists:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.infra -f docker-compose.infra.yaml run --rm seaweedfs-init
```

Server and worker nodes must use the same
`BROCCOLI__STORAGE__OBJECT_STORAGE__ENDPOINT`,
`BROCCOLI__STORAGE__OBJECT_STORAGE__ACCESS_KEY`, and
`BROCCOLI__STORAGE__OBJECT_STORAGE__SECRET_KEY`.

## LAN Credential Files

Infra and single-host installs generate two copyable files:

```bash
connection.env       # copy to servers and workers
server-secrets.env   # copy only to servers
```

Workers do not need `server-secrets.env`.

## Capacity Planning

Broccoli's per-machine throughput is bounded by the worker's intra-process
concurrency (`worker.max_concurrency`, currently default 1 — Phase 1 work raises
this safely). Total fleet drain time for a contest:

```
drain_seconds = (n_submissions * n_testcases * avg_op_time_seconds)
              / (n_machines * worker.max_concurrency)
```

For 100 submissions × 50 testcases × 5 s on 7 machines × 4 slots ≈ 30 minutes.

Servers default to local evaluator admission sizing. After worker heartbeats are
visible and include `worker.max_concurrency`, operators can enable
`BROCCOLI__SERVER__FLEET_AWARE_ADMISSION_ENABLED=true`; each server then polls
live worker/server heartbeats and sizes its evaluator slots to roughly
`sum(live worker max_concurrency) / live server replicas`.

**Deployment topology**

The official deployment model is **one worker process per physical machine**,
with the worker's own `max_concurrency` knob (default 1) controlling how many
sandbox slots run in parallel inside that single daemon.

Scale the fleet by adding machines, not by running multiple worker daemons on
the same box. Multiple processes per box would contend for CPU cache, memory
bandwidth, and SMT siblings, and the verdict signal Broccoli currently uses
(`time_used`, which is kernel CPU accounting) inflates under that contention —
borderline TLE outcomes can flip. The single-daemon model gives the operator one
number to reason about and one place to apply core-pinning / cgroup
configuration.

Raising `max_concurrency` above 1 within a single daemon has the same fairness
trade-off. Use the procedure below before changing it.

**Raising max_concurrency safely**

Default worker concurrency is `max_concurrency=1`. Leave it there unless the
worker host has been prepared for CPU isolation.

On the Linux worker host, run:

```bash
sudo ./release/setup-fairness.sh --max-concurrency 4 --cpus 0-3
cat fairness.env >> .env.worker
docker compose --env-file .env.worker -f docker-compose.worker.yaml up -d --no-deps worker
```

The script refuses to run when SMT/hyperthreading is enabled unless
`--allow-smt` is passed. It sets CPU governors to `performance` when the host
exposes writable governor controls, configures isolate per-box CPU assignments
so each sandbox `box_id` writes a fixed `cpuset.cpus`, and writes the worker env
snippet:

```bash
BROCCOLI__WORKER__MAX_CONCURRENCY=4
BROCCOLI__WORKER__FAIRNESS_UNSAFE_ALLOW=false
```

WSL and macOS are not supported production fairness targets. Use WSL only for
local isolate smoke tests and keep `BROCCOLI__WORKER__MAX_CONCURRENCY=1`; macOS
cannot run the Linux cgroup setup and should also stay clamped to 1.

Phase 1 only makes multi-slot judging an explicit operator opt-in. It does not
prove verdict fairness: instruction-count instrumentation with `perf_event_open`
is Phase 5. Treat any higher concurrency as an operational risk for borderline
time-limit cases until Phase 5 data exists.

**Sizing the database connection pool**

Postgres `max_connections` must accommodate every server replica's pool, every
worker's pool, plus heartbeat/DLQ/admin overhead. The tuned infra template
defaults to `max_connections=400`, which fits:

```
3 servers × 50 + 7 workers × 5 + heartbeat refreshers + DLQ + admin
≈ 215 client demand
```

Override via `POSTGRES_MAX_CONNECTIONS` in `.env.infra` if your fleet grows.

**Sizing Redis memory**

The tuned infra template defaults `--maxmemory 6gb`, sized for a 1000-submission
spike with the four-active-ops-per-submission windowing from Phase 2. Override
via `REDIS_MAXMEMORY`. Tiers:

| Deployment                     | Recommended `REDIS_MAXMEMORY` |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Single-host / small LAN demo   | `2gb`                         |
| Standard contest (≤1000 spike) | `6gb` (default)               |
| Large/national (≥5000 spike)   | `12gb`                        |

**Why `--maxmemory-policy noeviction` is mandatory**

Every key Broccoli writes to Redis is correctness-bearing: MQ payloads are
queued submissions, heartbeats drive worker-dedup steal logic, dedup keys carry
claim invariants, and the planned observability streams (see
`docs/plans/2026-05-07-observability-expansion-design.md`) hold live SSE state
admins watch. `allkeys-lru` would silently lose all of these. With `noeviction`,
a full Redis returns `OOM command not allowed`; workers retry, the API returns
`503 OVERLOADED`, and operators get an alert — fail-loud beats fail-silent.
Worker dedup keys expire via `BROCCOLI__WORKER__DEDUP_TTL_SECS` (default 600)
instead of the DLQ stuck-job timeout.

## Plugin Pool Sizing

The server holds per-plugin pools of WASM instances. Each parallel contest
evaluation acquires (1) an evaluator-semaphore slot and (2) one instance from
the contest plugin's pool, then re-enters the host to call the checker plugin,
which acquires one instance from the checker plugin's pool.

If the checker pool is smaller than the evaluator semaphore, every evaluator
holding a contest slot can simultaneously be waiting for a checker slot. No
checker slot will free until a contest call finishes, and no contest call will
finish until its checker returns — the fleet deadlocks.

The constraint is:

```
BROCCOLI__PLUGIN__POOL_MAX_INSTANCES >= BROCCOLI__PLUGIN__EVALUATOR_PARALLELISM
```

Both knobs are per-server-replica.

- `pool_max_instances` (default 32) caps concurrent calls into any single
  plugin. Every loaded plugin gets its own pool of this size, so contest and
  checker pools are independent — the constraint above is the only thing that
  ties them.
- `evaluator_parallelism` (default = `std::thread::available_parallelism()`) is
  the maximum number of evaluator calls a server admits concurrently. Raise it
  for contest workloads with high per-submission test-case fan-out.

For a typical contest workload, raise both:

```
BROCCOLI__PLUGIN__POOL_MAX_INSTANCES=64
BROCCOLI__PLUGIN__EVALUATOR_PARALLELISM=64
```

`release/.env.server.example` ships these as the multi-replica defaults.

**Diagnosing pool starvation.** A server stuck in the deadlock above shows up as
climbing `plugin_instance_acquire_duration` for the checker plugin and a flat
`plugin_instance_acquire_failures` (because callers wait rather than fail). The
fleet-aware admission semaphore will stop admitting new submissions; the API
returns `503 OVERLOADED`.

The longer-term fix is to move checker invocation out of the contest plugin call
path (so the contest call returns before the checker runs), which makes the
constraint disappear. That refactor is tracked as a follow-up and is not part of
Phase 1.

## Multi-Replica Server Identity

`BROCCOLI__SERVER__ID` **must** be set explicitly on every server replica in a
multi-server deployment. The release templates set it (`.env.server.example`
ships `BROCCOLI__SERVER__ID=server-1`); confirm each replica's `.env.server` has
a unique stable value (`server-1`, `server-2`, `server-3`, ...).

**Why it matters:** each server consumes its own per-replica result queue
(`operation_results.<server_id>`). If two replicas share the same ID, they will
race to consume each other's results. If a replica's ID is randomized at startup
(the fallback when `BROCCOLI__SERVER__ID` is empty and the OS hostname is
unsuitable), every restart leaves a permanent ghost queue in Redis that fills
memory until manually deleted.

The release `install.sh` prompts for the ID; if you bypass the installer, audit
each replica's env file before starting.

## Recovering In-Flight Submissions After a Server Crash

Unless the Phase 1b lease/steal mechanism is explicitly enabled, a server crash
leaves its in-flight submissions in `Running` status until the stuck-job
detector catches them (default 2 hours via `stuck_job_timeout_secs`). When this
happens:

1. Confirm the failed server is dead (not merely network-partitioned). Two
   replicas with the same ID racing on the same queue is worse than ghost
   queues.
2. After restart, the new server with the same ID consumes its old reply queue
   and drops the stale results (logged as "no waiter found"). The failed
   submissions still need to be re-submitted by the user — the platform does not
   automatically replay them.
3. If `redis-cli SCAN MATCH operation_results.*` shows queues with no live
   consumer (i.e. their `<server_id>` does not match any healthy replica),
   `redis-cli DEL <queue_name> <queue_name>_processing <queue_name>_failed <queue_name>_fairness_set`
   to reclaim the memory.

With `BROCCOLI__SERVER__DISPATCHER_LEASE_STEAL_ENABLED=true`, Phase 1b automates
the recovery loop foundation: servers write heartbeats, refresh owned leases,
and dry-run ghost reply-queue sweeps. Steal scanning remains behind the same
opt-in rollout path until the dispatch replay path is enabled.
