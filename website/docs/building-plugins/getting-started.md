# Getting started

A Broccoli plugin is a WebAssembly module that runs inside the Broccoli server,
plus an optional React bundle that runs in the web frontend. The backend module
reaches the platform through host functions for the database, configuration, and
logging, gated by the permissions it declares. This page builds a plugin end to
end, using the shipped `cooldown` plugin as the worked example.

## The contract

Your backend code runs as a sandboxed WASM module. It does not open sockets or
touch the filesystem. It talks to the host through declared host functions, and
its HTTP handlers return a JSON value, never a file or a stream. That is why a
plugin coordinates and stores data while anything binary, like a rendered PDF,
has to live in a separate native client. Knowing this up front saves you from
designing against the grain.

A plugin can add two kinds of behavior:

- Backend routes and hooks, written in Rust and compiled to WASM.
- Frontend components, written in React and mounted into named UI slots.

## Prerequisites

- Rust nightly with the `wasm32-wasip1` target. The scaffold pins both in
  `rust-toolchain.toml`.
- The Broccoli CLI. The crate is `broccoli-dev-cli` and the installed binary is
  `broccoli-dev`.
- `pnpm`, if your plugin has a frontend.
- A running Broccoli server to upload to.

Install the CLI:

```bash
cargo install broccoli-dev-cli
```

## Scaffold a plugin

```bash
broccoli-dev plugin new my-plugin --full
```

Use `--backend`, `--frontend`, or `--full` to pick what gets generated. Without
one of those flags the command asks. The scaffold lands in `./my-plugin`, or
pass `-o <DIR>` to write it elsewhere.

## Anatomy

Three files define a backend plugin.

### plugin.toml

The manifest. It names the plugin, declares what the backend may do, and maps
events and routes to exported functions. Here is the `cooldown` manifest, trimmed
to its backend:

```toml
name = "cooldown"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Submission cooldown timer"

[server]
entry = "cooldown_plugin.wasm"
permissions = ["logger", "sql", "config:read"]

[[server.hooks]]
topic = "before_submission"
function = "check_cooldown"
scope = "resource"

[[server.routes]]
method = "GET"
path = "/api/plugins/cooldown/problems/{problem_id}/status"
handler = "get_cooldown_status_standalone"
```

- `entry` is the WASM filename the build produces.
- `permissions` gate host access. Without `sql` the database host functions are
  not available, and so on.
- A hook subscribes a function to a platform event, here `before_submission`.
- A route maps an HTTP method and path to an exported function. Path parameters
  like `{problem_id}` are read inside the handler.

### Cargo.toml

```toml
[package]
name = "cooldown-plugin"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2024"

[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib", "rlib"]

[dependencies]
broccoli-server-sdk = { path = "../../packages/server-sdk", features = ["guest"] }
extism-pdk = "1.0"
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
```

The `cdylib` crate type produces the WASM module. The `guest` feature on
`broccoli-server-sdk` turns on the host function wrappers your code calls.

### src/lib.rs

Exported functions are marked with `#[plugin_fn]`. A route handler takes the
request as a string and returns a JSON string. `run_api_handler` decodes the
request and hands you a typed `Host` and `PluginHttpRequest`:

```rust
use broccoli_server_sdk::prelude::*;
use extism_pdk::{plugin_fn, FnResult};

#[plugin_fn]
pub fn get_cooldown_status_standalone(input: String) -> FnResult<String> {
    run_api_handler(&input, handle_status)
}

fn handle_status(
    host: &Host,
    req: &PluginHttpRequest,
) -> Result<PluginHttpResponse, ApiError> {
    let user_id = req
        .require_user_id()
        .map_err(|_| PluginHttpResponse::error(401, "Authentication required"))?;
    let problem_id: i32 = req.param("problem_id")?;

    let eff = host.config.get_effective("cooldown", problem_id, None)?;

    Ok(PluginHttpResponse {
        status: 200,
        headers: None,
        body: Some(serde_json::json!({
            "enabled": eff.is_enabled,
            "user_id": user_id,
        })),
    })
}
```

The response `body` is a `serde_json` value. That is the JSON-only contract in
practice.

A hook returns a small JSON decision instead of an HTTP response. The cooldown
hook reads its config, checks the last submission time through `host.db`, and
returns either `{"action": "pass"}` or a rejection:

```rust
#[plugin_fn]
pub fn check_cooldown(input: String) -> FnResult<String> {
    let host = Host::new();
    let event: BeforeSubmissionEvent = serde_json::from_str(&input)?;

    let eff = host
        .config
        .get_effective("cooldown", event.problem_id, event.contest_id)?;
    if !eff.is_enabled {
        return Ok(serde_json::to_string(&serde_json::json!({"action": "pass"}))?);
    }

    // ... query host.db for seconds since the last submission ...

    Ok(serde_json::to_string(&serde_json::json!({"action": "pass"}))?)
}
```

## Build and install

```bash
broccoli-dev plugin build my-plugin --install
```

Because the manifest has a `[server]` section, the CLI runs
`cargo build --target wasm32-wasip1` and copies the artifact to the `entry` path.
`--install` places the build where a local server loads it. Add `--release` for
an optimized module. If the manifest has a `[web]` section, the CLI also runs the
frontend build.

## Iterate against a running server

Sign in once, then watch the directory. The CLI rebuilds on every change and
uploads the new bundle:

```bash
broccoli-dev login --server http://localhost:3000
broccoli-dev plugin watch my-plugin --server http://localhost:3000
```

`broccoli-dev login` stores credentials in `~/.config/broccoli/credentials.json`. You
can override them with `BROCCOLI_URL` and `BROCCOLI_TOKEN`, or with `--server`
and `--token`.

## Where to go next

- The host surface lives behind `host`. Use `host.db` with the `Params` builder
  for parameterized SQL, `host.config.get_effective` for layered configuration,
  and `host.log` for logging.
- Declare a `[config.<plugin>]` block in `plugin.toml` to get a settings form in
  the admin UI, scoped to a problem, a contest, or a contest problem.
- Mount frontend components into named slots with the web SDK. See the
  `[web]` and `[[web.slots]]` sections of a full plugin manifest.
