//! UP#39 backpressure-on-post: counts and admission-control for the
//! durable `Queued` row depth.
//!
//! Post-UP#37 the API no longer dispatches submissions in-process at
//! the request boundary; instead, each POST handler inserts a row with
//! `status='Queued'` and returns 201 immediately. The per-server
//! UP#38 claim fiber (`dispatcher/claim.rs`) drains these rows by
//! flipping them to `Pending` and handing them off to the existing
//! plugin path.
//!
//! The natural backpressure signal is therefore **the live count of
//! `status='Queued'` rows across the three tables that carry the
//! durable-accept lifecycle**: `submission`, `code_run`, and
//! `submission_judgement`. When that depth exceeds
//! `server.max_queued_submissions`, accepting more work would only
//! grow the buffer between ingress and dispatch - degrading p95
//! POST->Pending latency without changing throughput. Better to shed
//! load at the door with `503 Service Unavailable` + `Retry-After`.
//!
//! The check is best-effort: there is no transactional coupling
//! between the COUNT and the subsequent INSERT, so a small overshoot
//! is possible under concurrent POSTs. The cap is for steady-state
//! load shedding, not strict admission, so racing past the threshold
//! by a few dozen rows is acceptable.
