//! SystemError-retry reaper.
//!
//! A `SystemError` verdict reflects a SYSTEM-side condition — the interactive
//! manager failed to compile under contention, a contestant compile step hit a
//! sandbox error, an operation result was lost — never the contestant's own
//! code. The contest invariant forbids such a condition from standing as the
//! contestant's verdict.
//!
//! This fiber reconciles from the durable terminal state rather than any
//! in-flight control-flow site, which is what makes it path-agnostic: it does
//! not matter whether the submission was judged synchronously (batch) or via the
//! detached operation path (interactive) — both finalize the same
//! `submission_judgement` row, and the reaper sees it. It periodically scans for
//! current, finalized judgements whose terminal outcome is a `SystemError` in any
//! of its shapes — plugin-finalized (`status == Judged` + `verdict ==
//! SystemError`) or stuck-handler-terminal / dispatch-exhaustion (`status ==
//! SystemError`) — with retry budget remaining, requeues them to a fresh epoch
//! (in lockstep with the parent submission, results wiped — see
//! [`crate::services::submission_dispatch::requeue_judgement_for_system_error_retry`])
//! and re-dispatches them. Bounded by `max_system_error_retries`; only when the
//! budget is exhausted does the `SystemError` stand (a genuinely broken problem).
//!
//! The reaper lives in a top-level fiber (not in the dispatch call graph), so the
//! re-dispatch is a plain `dispatch_to_plugin_with_judgement` call with no
//! recursion. Re-dispatch passes `fire_after_judging = true` so a retried
//! submission still fires its after-judging hooks when it finally completes.
