//! Dedicated tokio runtime + listener for `/healthz` and `/metrics` (UP#14e).
//!
//! Under deliberate api-runtime saturation (large submission bursts, scheduler
//! thrash, blocking work pinned to the main runtime's worker threads), the
//! liveness probe served on the main router can stall well past any sensible
//! probe timeout — defeating its entire purpose as an out-of-band signal. To
//! sidestep that, this module hosts a tiny axum app with only `/healthz` and
//! `/metrics` on its **own** `tokio::runtime::Runtime` running on its **own**
//! `std::thread`, bound to its **own** TCP listener (and therefore its own
//! port).
//!
//! The main runtime's saturation can no longer block the probe path because
//! the two runtimes share nothing but the [`AppState`] handles (Arc'd
//! database pool, Arc'd Redis client). Those handles are safe to share across
//! runtimes — they're already designed for arbitrary task counts and do not
//! pin themselves to a specific runtime.
//!
//! Activation is opt-in via `server.healthz_listen`. When `None`, this module
//! is unused and `/healthz` + `/metrics` are served only on the main router
//! (legacy behavior).
