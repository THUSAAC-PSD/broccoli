///    server-side "invalid byte sequence ... 0x00" errors on byte-clean plugin

///    the same pool (see docs/plans/2026-06-25-nul-byte-root-cause.md). Plugin
///    host functions always run their DB call to completion (sync `block_on` on
///    a blocking thread, never cancelled), so a pool used ONLY by them stays
///    clean. No schema-sync/seeding here - the main pool already ran it.
///
/// 2. **Least privilege (phase 2 of the SQL-capability redesign)** - every
///    connection runs `SET ROLE broccoli_plugin` before the plugin can use it,
///    via sqlx's per-connection `after_connect` hook. `broccoli_plugin` is a
///    NOLOGIN role (created + granted in [`init_db_with_max_connections`]) that
///    the app role is a MEMBER of. It has only `SELECT` on core tables and does
///    not OWN them, so raw plugin SQL can READ core state but can neither
///    write it (no INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE granted) nor DROP/ALTER it
///    (ownership-gated by Postgres). A plugin's OWN tables - created via raw
///    `CREATE TABLE` under this role - are owned by `broccoli_plugin`, so the
///    plugin keeps full read/write/DDL on them. Legitimate core WRITES keep
///    working because the gated `host.submission.*` (phase 1), `host.storage.*`,
///    and `config:write` host fns run on the PRIVILEGED pool
///    ([`init_plugin_db_privileged`]), which does NOT `SET ROLE`.
///
/// `login`, when `Some`, overrides the URL's username/password so the pool
/// authenticates as the dedicated least-privilege [`PLUGIN_DB_LOGIN_ROLE`]
/// rather than the (privileged) app login role. This is what makes a plugin's
/// `RESET ROLE` land on a non-privileged role instead of the app role; the
/// after-connect `SET ROLE broccoli_plugin` still runs on top for normal
