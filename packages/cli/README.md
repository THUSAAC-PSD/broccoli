# broccoli-cli

`broccoli-cli` installs the `broccoli` command.

It is the command-line tool used to scaffold Broccoli plugins, build them
locally, and watch a plugin directory while pushing changes to a running
Broccoli server.

## Install

```bash
cargo install broccoli-cli
```

If you are working in the Broccoli monorepo and want the local checkout instead:

```bash
cargo install --path packages/cli
```

## What it does

The CLI currently covers four jobs:

- Sign in to a Broccoli server with the device-code flow.
- Scaffold a new plugin directory with backend, frontend, or full templates.
- Build a plugin's backend WASM and frontend bundle from `plugin.toml`.
- Watch a plugin directory, rebuild on changes, and upload the result.

## Commands

### `broccoli login`

Starts the device-code login flow against a Broccoli server.

```bash
broccoli login
broccoli login --server http://localhost:3000
```

On success, credentials are stored in `~/.config/broccoli/credentials.json`. You
can also override them per command with `BROCCOLI_URL` and `BROCCOLI_TOKEN`, or
by passing `--server` and `--token` to `broccoli plugin watch`.

### `broccoli plugin new`

Creates a plugin scaffold from the built-in templates.

```bash
broccoli plugin new my-plugin --full
broccoli plugin new judge-tools --backend
broccoli plugin new contest-banner --frontend
```

By default, `broccoli plugin new` asks which kind of scaffold to generate. Use
`--backend`, `--frontend`, or `--full` to make the command non-interactive.

Useful flags:

- `-o, --output <DIR>` writes the scaffold somewhere other than `./<name>`.
- `--server-sdk <SPEC>` changes the backend SDK dependency written into the
  generated `Cargo.toml`.
- `--web-sdk <SPEC>` changes the frontend SDK dependency written into the
  generated `package.json`.

### `broccoli plugin build`

Builds the plugin described by the `plugin.toml` in the target directory.

```bash
broccoli plugin build
broccoli plugin build plugins/ioi
broccoli plugin build plugins/ioi --release
```

What gets built depends on the manifest:

- If the manifest has a `[server]` section, the CLI runs
  `cargo build --target wasm32-wasip1` and copies the built artifact to the
  manifest's configured entry path.
- If the manifest has a `[web]` section, the CLI runs a frontend build command
  and leaves the output in the manifest's configured web root.

If your frontend is not in the default location, add a `broccoli.dev.toml` next
to `plugin.toml`:

```toml
[build]
frontend_dir = "web"
frontend_cmd = "pnpm build"
```

Without that file, the CLI tries to infer the frontend directory from
`[web].root`, then falls back to `web/`, `frontend/`, or the plugin root if a
`package.json` is present.

### `broccoli plugin watch`

Watches a plugin directory, rebuilds on changes, and uploads new bundles to a
Broccoli server.

```bash
broccoli login --server http://localhost:3000
broccoli plugin watch plugins/ioi --server http://localhost:3000
```

For backend changes, the CLI rebuilds the WASM module itself. For frontend
plugins, it starts a long-running dev command and watches the output directory
for fresh assets before packaging and uploading again.

Useful flags:

- `--server <URL>` overrides the saved server URL.
- `--token <TOKEN>` overrides the saved token.
- `--release` uses release builds for backend rebuilds.
- `--debounce <MS>` changes the file-watch debounce interval.

You can customize watch behavior with `broccoli.dev.toml`:

```toml
[watch]
ignore = ["*.log", "coverage/"]

[build]
frontend_dir = "web"
frontend_cmd = "pnpm build"
frontend_dev_cmd = "pnpm dev"
```

Built-in ignores are always active for `target/`, `.git/`, and `node_modules/`.

## Typical workflow

Create a plugin, build it once, then switch to watch mode while the server is
running:

```bash
broccoli plugin new my-plugin --full
cd my-plugin/web
pnpm install
cd ../..
broccoli plugin build my-plugin
broccoli login --server http://localhost:3000
broccoli plugin watch my-plugin --server http://localhost:3000
```

## Notes

- The published crate name is `broccoli-cli`, but the installed binary is
  `broccoli`.
- `broccoli plugin build` and `broccoli plugin watch` both expect to find a
  `plugin.toml` in the target directory.
